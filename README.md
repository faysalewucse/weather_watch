    - `view_model/` - Contains repositories and controllers used in the app.
        - `repositories/` - Responsible for data handling and API calls.
        - `service/` - Holds the business logic and connects the UI to data sources.
    - `utils/` - Utility functions, constants, and extensions.
        - `constants/` - Constant values, assets, image paths, and theme colors.
        - `device/` - Contains utilities for checking device features.

## Key Dependencies

- **GetX**: For state management, dependency injection, and routing.
- **Freezed & JsonSerializable**: For immutable model classes and JSON serialization.
